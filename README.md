Known Issues / Bugs

    1080p & 480p Videos:
    There is no audio available in 1080p and 480p videos because the itags that combine both audio and video at these resolutions are currently not working in Pytube. If you have any suggestions or fixes, feel free to contribute to the program!

    Limited Video Qualities:
    The available quality options are limited to the itags provided by YouTube for the given video. If a certain resolution or quality is unavailable, the program will notify you.
